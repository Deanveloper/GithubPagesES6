# Website

As a big "heck-you" to old browsers, my website no longer uses babel to translate my JavaScript. Websites should be simple, I shouldn't need to run my webpages through a preprocessor in order for it to work. So I don't anymore! It's really relieving.

Also, I recently translated it to use [Vue](https://vuejs.org)! I highly recommend it, it's extremely simple and much nicer (in my opinion) than React and Angular. It really made everything a lot neater.
