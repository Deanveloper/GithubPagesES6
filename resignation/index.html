	<title>Dean's Resignation</title>
</head>
<body>
<!-- Note to admins, feel free to delete all of my accounts for gitlab and whatever else we had. I plan on keeping the Creative Plugin (not like you guys think it's that good anyway) and I'll be rewriting it in Kotlin. I'm not going to do anything stupid like give away passwords or installing a virus on the boxes. I'm leaving in peace. -->
	<div id="paperLookinThing">
		<h1>Well, looks like it has come to this.</h1>
		
		<p>To make it short and sweet, I'm resigning. There are several reasons why I'm doing this. One, I stopped enjoying my job here a long time ago. I stuck with it because I enjoyed the community, although now too many things recently have come up, and I'm leaving. There are several reasons, so let me explain myself.</p>
		
		<p>First off, I feel like I do way more harm to the network than good. I broke the server the other week while updating the creative plugin, and I broke creative like 3 times in the process. To be fair, I stayed up 2 hours after I updated it (it was updated around 2am, so I was up until like 4am-ish) and then I wake up to madness because roads were breakable (something I hadn't thought of testing, oops). I also made a change in our core plugin that broke some of our game servers, although everything that happened was pretty quickly fixed.</p>
		
		<p>There have been a few decisions lately that don't seem quite right. We have a team of HMods, supposedly to make our staff team more led by the staff than by just Teamplayer, although he's the one who picked out the staff who would be promoted (and no, "is everyone ok with this decision" doesn't mean it was the staff's decision who was picked). The HMod team is afraid to speak against Teamplayer and always agrees with him. At least that's what I've been told, since I'm not able to attend the HMod meetings despite the fact that I'm 90% sure that Paul and I are the only two on the team actually trained in Leadership.</p>
		
		<p>Also umong these decisions, we banned a staff member for death threats when basically what they said was "I wouldn't mind if Teamplayer died," a bit more gory but that's not the point. The leadership team gave them a very severe ingame punishment for something they said not only out of game, but in a completely separate server chat. Honestly, I can believe a demotion for being immature outside of PZ. That's fit. but denying them to even log on? I don't think so.</p>
		
		<p>Let's talk about that snapchat thing with Jeb and I. Here's the gist of it: Jeb sent me an all-black snapchat saying "raise your hand if you want Team demoted". I made a response with Dakota, Sidney (Dakota's IRL friend, my girlfriend for those that don't know), Cheyenne (their friend), and I all raising our hands with the caption "Raise your hand if you want Team demoted" and sent it to several people. I posted the picture in Josh's casual chat, and I guess someone told Teamplayer. I basically get a warning for it, although Jeb nearly got demoted. Dakota apparently wasn't even talked to? I guess? Not quite sure what's going on there. Either way, nobody should've gotten in trouble. Real leaders wouldn't punish someone for speaking against them. They'd either try to fix what's wrong about themselves, or let a different leader take their place.</p>
		
		<p>The last reason I'm leaving is because of the lack of respect our new owner has. He talks behind several people's backs. These people are my friends, and apparently now he talks about me too. Whether the things are true or not, perhaps he should bring it up and talk with the person about it instead of complaining to one his favorite staff members. I'm not going to be associated with a company whose owner is completely and utterly disrespectful towards his volunteers.</p>
		
		<p>Oh, by the way, our admins could have been paid for well over a year. But instead I've been doing volunteer work for the past two years. As I said before, I'm not going to volunteer my time to a company who's going to be talking trash, especially about the people who take time out of their day to help keep the server running.</p>
		
		<p>This isn't goodbye, I'll come by and visit every once in a while. I hope to stay in touch with my friends here, I'm not removing anyone on skype or anything like that. But I am leaving the admin team now. Hopefully the leadership team will take a few tips from this letter, as I'd much rather the server fix what's wrong with itself than for it to die out. I really did enjoy most of my time here, or at least most of it, and I've gained a ton of experience by doing this.</p>
		
		<br />
		<p>Sincerely,</p>
		<p>Dean</p>
